# Insurance-Analytics
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an end-to-end Insurance Analytics Dashboard that provides real-time visibility into policy performance, claims activity, sales pipelines, and branch-level KPIs. The solution helps business stakeholders make data-driven decisions by centralizing fragmented data into interactive dashboards.
The project simulates a real-world insurance analytics use case, covering the complete data lifecycle—from Excel-based data preparation to SQL integration and BI dashboard development.
